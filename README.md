datastructures
==============

Fun with data structures and unit testing in C.

slisti
------

A singly-linked integer list implementation that aims to offer some of the
modern conveniences we've come to expect from the likes of Python, such as
- negative indexes,
- slicing,
- searching,
- map/filter/reduce,
- JSON input/output.

hashmap
-------

A hashmap implementation backed by singly-linked lists, using a very basic (and
fast) key hashing function, supporting dynamic resizing.
